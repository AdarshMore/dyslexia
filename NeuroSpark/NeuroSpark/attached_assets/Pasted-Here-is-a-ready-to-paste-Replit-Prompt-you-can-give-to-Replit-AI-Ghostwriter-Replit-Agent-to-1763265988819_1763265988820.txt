### **📱 Build a Mobile App for Neurodiverse Learners (React Native + Expo)**

I want you to build a complete **React Native (Expo)** mobile app called **NeuroLearn**, designed to support learners with **Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, Dyscalculia, Auditory Processing Disorder, and Visual Processing Disorder**.

### **APP DESCRIPTION**

This app should be a **multi-modal learning product** with:

* A **Math Game** designed for dyscalculia-friendly learning
* A **Progress Tracking Dashboard** (charts, stats, badges)
* Accessibility-first UI (large fonts, minimal clutter, high contrast)
* Calm animations and audio cues
* AI-based personalization hooks (dummy functions now)
* Modular structure so I can scale later

---

### **📌 REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. Home Screen**

* Tiles for:

  * Math Game
  * Progress Dashboard
  * Daily Learning Tasks
  * Parent/Educator Tips
* Use soft colors, accessible font sizes, and simple icons.

---

### **2. Math Game (Main Feature)**

Build a math mini-game designed for dyscalculia support:

* Large buttons, single question per screen
* Difficulty levels
* Timed + untimed mode
* Immediate positive feedback
* Types of tasks:

  * Number recognition
  * Simple addition/subtraction
  * Shape & pattern matching
  * Visual counting (dots, objects)
* Save scores to local storage (AsyncStorage)

---

### **3. Progress Tracking Dashboard**

Include:

* Line chart for progress over time
* Badges (e.g., “Consistency Star”, “5 Correct in a Row”)
* Streak counter
* Total sessions played
* Personal best
* Friendly messages like “You’re improving!”

Use any chart library compatible with Expo (e.g., `react-native-chart-kit`).

---

### **4. Accessibility**

* Adjustable font size
* Colorblind-safe theme
* Optional text-to-speech
* Voice instructions for math questions
* Haptic feedback (light vibration on success)

---

### **5. Architecture**

Use:

* React Native + Expo
* Context API for global state
* AsyncStorage for saving progress
* Modular folder structure:

  ```
  /screens
  /components
  /services
  /context
  /assets
  ```

---

### **6. Extra Features**

Include placeholder screens (empty UI with text):

* Parent & Educator Support Tools
* Community Support
* Personalization (AI) – just a dummy hook for now
* Settings Page:

  * Toggle sound
  * Toggle animations
  * Adjust difficulty
  * Text size slider

---

### **7. Deliverables**

Please generate:

1. Full project folder structure
2. All React Native code (screens, components, providers)
3. Math game logic
4. Dashboard with charts
5. AsyncStorage implementations
6. Clean UI with accessibility tweaks
7. Onboarding screen explaining the mission
8. Instructions on how to run on Replit or Expo Go

---

### **OUTPUT FORMAT**

* Provide the complete code files as individual blocks
* Make sure the app runs out-of-the-box
* Do not summarize — give full project code
* Use Expo Router if possible
* Include comments so I understand each part

---

### **Build this entire mobile app now.**

---

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A full UI/UX Wireframe
✅ API design for personalization
✅ Firebase or Supabase backend integration
✅ Gamification badges & reward system
✅ Curriculum design for dyslexia/dyscalculia learners

Just tell me!
